# 🔐 Secure Banking System – SWE 314 Project

This project was developed as part of the **Software Security Engineering (SWE 314)** course at **King Saud University**.

It is a **simple banking system** designed with basic security features. The main goal is to help students understand how to integrate security into software, such as:

- Secure login with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Viewing account information and transaction history
- Performing transactions (bill payments, money transfers)
- Updating user profiles
- Sending messages to the bank
- Using **encryption algorithms** to protect sensitive data
- Applying **role-based access control (RBAC)** for employees

## 🔧 My Contribution

I worked on:
- Implementing the **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** encryption algorithm
- Supporting and contributing to other parts of the project like:
  - Testing
  - Security planning
  - System design

## 📁 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java 
- Architecture: 3-tier system (client – logic – database)
- Security: DES encryption, input validation, RBAC

## 📚 Note

This project was done by a group of students and not all features were fully completed. The main focus was learning how to build more secure systems.
